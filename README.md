# nkn-esi

NKN-ESI (or **nESI**) is an [NKN](https://nkn.org/) based Energy Services Interface (ESI). An ESI supports a distributed
marketplace for energy services on the electricity grid. It can be used to facilitate services such as load shifting
(e.g. delaying energy consumption to help with peak capacity management) or the timed increased consumption of energy
(e.g. activating devices to consume energy to mitigate a high voltage situation). The purpose of these services is to
allow an aggregator, utility, or distribution system operator to easily and cost effectively maintain a stable and
resilient electricity grid.

By developing NKN-ESI, we hope to show that an ESI which leverages NKN could be a very simple, secure, and resilient
mechanism for building, factory, facility, or distributed energy resource operators to offer and provide energy services
to a range of entities responsible for aspects of grid stability.

## Previous Work

A previous application of this ESI can be found at
[SolarNetwork](https://github.com/SolarNetwork/der-challenge-prototype), developed for the
[SEPA DER Challenge](https://sepapower.org/plug-and-play-der-challenge/).
